I have a very cool job.  I teach elementary kids about science and engineering at a local charter school.  In my endeaver to make complicated things simple enough for young students to understand I have learned a tremendous amount myself and changed forever my view of science, but that's another story.  Why did I get interested in coding?  Well, I met a woman who is a STEM Coordinator for a large school district and we had a great conversation about the problem of adding new  curriculum in schools.  We boiled it down to the fact that many teachers dislike being uncomfortable, and learning new things makes pretty much everyone uncomfortable.  Since I started teaching engineering I've been very uncomfortable a lot of the time.  I've been to several very intense training classes that redefine "uncomfortable".   What I have realized is that I like being uncomfortable.  I like things that are challenging and that make me think and work hard.  I like to learn.  I shared with the STEM Coordinator that I would not be able to go to any of the aforementioned training classes this summer but that I wanted to learn something new.  She suggested coding school.  "Hello World"!
